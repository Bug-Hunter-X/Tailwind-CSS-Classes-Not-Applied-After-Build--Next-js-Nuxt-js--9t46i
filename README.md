# Tailwind CSS Build Issue in Next.js/Nuxt.js

This repository demonstrates a common problem when integrating Tailwind CSS into JavaScript frameworks that use a build process. The problem is that Tailwind directives are not properly processed during the build stage, leading to missing styles or unexpected behavior in the final build. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to build the Next.js application using `npm run build`.
4. Observe the missing styles in the built application.
