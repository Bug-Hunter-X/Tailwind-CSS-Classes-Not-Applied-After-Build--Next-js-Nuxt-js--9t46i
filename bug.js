This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, or frameworks that use a build process.  The issue is that the Tailwind directives aren't being processed correctly during the build stage, resulting in classes not being applied, or causing unexpected behavior.  This usually shows up as styling not being applied or CSS compilation errors.

Example (Next.js):
```javascript
// pages/index.js
<div class="p-4 bg-blue-500 text-white">Hello world</div>
```

This code might appear correctly in the browser during development but fails after a build.
